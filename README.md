## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![Page screenshot](images/page-sc.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. In this project, I've learned by experimenting with more complex Flexbox CSS. And this is the third time I've applied design to code.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
