## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Custom Variable
- CSS Flexbox
- Bootstrap Framework ([Bootstrap Framework site](https://getbootstrap.com))
- Animate on Scroll Library ([AOS Library site](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/))

### What I learned

In this project, I've learned by experimenting with more complex Flexbox CSS. And this is the third time I've applied design to code.

### Continued development

I hope that in the future, I will always experience developments in making websites or applying designs to websites.
